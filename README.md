# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the application after cloning the repository:

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd PeerLink_frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Expo development server**

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

   This will open the Expo Developer Tools in your browser. You can then choose to run the app on:

   - [Development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
   - [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
   - [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
   - [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) app on your physical device (scan the QR code)

4. **Start developing**

   Edit files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Resetting the Project

To reset the project to a blank state:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command moves the starter code to the **app-example** directory and creates a blank **app** directory.
